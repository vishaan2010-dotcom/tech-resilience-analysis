# Global Tech Industry Volatility Analysis (2024-2025)

### Project Overview
While news headlines focus on "Big Tech" generally, this project uses Python to analyze which specific sub-sectors of the technology economy are most volatile. By aggregating layoff data and stability scores, I aimed to identify where the highest risk lies for incoming workforce talent.

### The Findings
My analysis reveals a distinct split in industry resilience:
* **High Risk:** The **Retail** and **Consumer App** sectors have crossed the "High Risk Threshold" (marked in red), largely due to their reliance on discretionary consumer spending.
* **High Stability:** Sectors like **Healthcare** and **Legal Tech** remain highly resilient, showing that essential services are insulated from broader market volatility.

### Methodology
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas (Data Analysis), Seaborn (Visualization).
* **Technique:** I processed industry performance metrics to calculate a "Volatility Score" and visualized the disparity between essential vs. non-essential tech sectors.
