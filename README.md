# Tech Industry Resilience Analysis (2024-2025)

### Project Objective
This project investigates the "Resilience Gap" in the technology sector following the economic shifts of 2024. My goal was to identify which sub-sectors provide the most stability for incoming talent and how these trends manifest in the **Seattle/Redmond tech corridor**.

### Local Analysis: The Pacific Northwest (PNW) Impact
As a student in the Greater Seattle area, I focused specifically on the resilience of local tech giants. My findings indicate that while major retailers and social media platforms faced significant corrections, the **Software/AI** and **Search** sectors (critical to the Redmond/Kirkland economy) showed higher relative stability despite larger raw numbers.

### Global Volatility Trends
My broader analysis shows that essential services like **Healthcare Tech** and **Legal Tech** are effectively insulated from market volatility, while consumer-discretionary sectors like **Retail** have crossed the high-risk threshold.

### Technical Implementation
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for statistical visualization.
* **Problem Solving:** Standardized inconsistent industry naming conventions to ensure data integrity across 2,000+ data points.
